    <h1>Welcome Maria and Petru: Our New Summer Interns!</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;
            text-align: justify;">We are thrilled to announce a significant milestone for our research group! The Agencia Española de Investigación has awarded us substantial funding for a groundbreaking project titled "New Computational Methods to Compute and Analyze Response Properties," spanning from 2023 to 2026. </p>
            <p>This funding represents a crucial moment in our journey to push the boundaries of computational chemistry and unlock new horizons in understanding molecular properties. </p>
            <p> In addition to the flagship project, we are also actively involved in "New Excited State Wavefunction Methods for Optoelectronics," another innovative research initiative. These projects collectively reflect our commitment to advancing the field and driving innovation in computational chemistry.</p>
            <p> For more details about our funding and ongoing projects, please visit our <a href="https://quantchemdev.github.io/fundings.html"> Funding Page</a>.</p>
