    <h1> Short stay visit: Lexin Ding:</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;
            text-align: justify;"> Earlier this month, we had the thrilling visit of Lexin Ding, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. </p>
            <p> Lexin showed us some of his recent work and gave us a talk entitled "Concepts of Orbital Entanglement and Correlation in Quantum Chemistry", under the KT seminar series that are offered in the DIPC. </p>
            <p> As we usually do in our group, we enjoyed a wonderful dinner all together, discussing both academic and non-academic topics. Overall, it we all spent an amazing time together. </p>
            <p> Thanks again for coming and sharing your work with us, Lexin! We are very grateful for your visit, and we hope the best for your academic career! </p>
