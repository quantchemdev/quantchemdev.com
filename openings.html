                    <p><strong>Project Title: Aromaticity and Magnetic Properties in Large Conjugated Rings</strong></p>
                    <p>We offer a two-month summer internship at the Quantum Chemistry Development group to work on aromaticity. The call is open for applications until the end of March.</p>
                    <p>The candidate will learn how to quantify aromaticity using computational chemistry, including concepts like electron delocalization, delocalization error, and the electronic and magnetic aspects of aromaticity.</p>

                    <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) has developed significantly since its inception, now being widely used to study electronic structures. However, current density functional approximations are still far from perfect and often lack predictive power. We are offering a PhD position to address these challenges.</p>

                    <p>The position focuses on advancing Density Functional Theory (DFT) to overcome its current limitations. This project aims to develop new strategies for constructing DFAs, breaking them into simpler components for more accurate and robust results.</p>
                    <p>Applicants should have a strong background in electronic structure theory and programming skills. Experience in developing density functional approximations or other computational methods is highly desirable.</p>
                    <p>The position is initially for one year, with the possibility of extension up to three years. Interested candidates should submit their CV and a brief statement of interest to Dr. Eduard Matito (ematito@gmail.com).</p>
                    <center><p>This project has received funding from the Spanish Government’s grant program “Europa Excelencia 2019” and the DIPC.</p></center>

                    <p>We offer a paid internship at DIPC for students interested in research and development of electronic structure methods. Candidates will work on addressing strong correlation problems in electronic structure simulations using new models designed in our group.</p>
                    <p>The internship requires basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and enthusiasm for learning about electronic structure theory and DFT.</p>
